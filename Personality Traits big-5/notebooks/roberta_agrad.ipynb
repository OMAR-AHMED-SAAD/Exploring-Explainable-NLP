the stars That would be neat to be able to impress people with my boundless knowledge about the boundless sky I think I have a pretty good chance at getting the job I was the very first person to call after she put the advertisement in She told me to come in for an informal interview mostly to show me around the place and introduce me to people By the time I got there 5 other people had called Today she said she had spoke to about 30 people and narrowed it down among me and two other people I think the interview went pretty well I concentrated on sending out a hire me vibe I wonder if being the first caller will increase my chances What a cool job So John has asked me to go see Giant with him tonight I think Ill go I hope he does not fall for me That sounds conceited but almost all of the guys that I want to be just friends with have a nasty habit of falling madly in love with me its really annoying Maybe I should concentrate on being just friends with all the boys and that way the ones that I want to fall madly in love with me will this sounds like the null hypothesis that we learned about in biology the other day Its something like making a hypothesis based on past data its based on the theory that all populations are alike and any abnormalities are due to chance alone So if all the boys that I Am just friends with fall for me all the boys that I continue to be just friends with will fall for me At least in some way I think I Am a likeable person I think people feel relaxed around me People are always telling me things and then saying I cannot believe I just told you that things just tend to slip out So I may go see Giant tonight I think James Dean is in that My sister used to be a huge James Dean fan That Is a main reason why I Am going I love my sister She is so smart and I was thinking last Monday night that she has influenced me in many wonderful ways I was at my friends house last night and Jeremy started playing blackbird on the guitar My sister and I shared a room for a while and she would always play that song as I was falling asleep Not because she wanted to play me a lullaby or anything just because she was trying to teach herself guitar which she did very well by the way The other song she used to always play was um  I forget the name but this guy was playing it on the street today Today it made me smile while the other night Black Bird almost made me cry I was in a sad emotional mood I think I get moody right before and right after my period The other night was right after What was that  song its by pink Floyd Oh well I really want to get my CD player back its up in Denton at my x boyfriends place because I was not going to need it this summer so I let him borrow it Ill see him in a couple of weeks I have mixed feelings about seeing him I Am excited but scarred that I Am really not going to like him anymore I think hes going to move to Austin over Christmas I hope that works out I also hope we can find some happy medium to our relationship He was one of the reasons that I was so down the other night I think I was lonely for a male companion or something And I sort of have this crush on that guy Jeremy His roommates are Jill and Leslie Jeremy and Jill used to date but John Jeremys best friend who I Am going to the movies with tonight says that Jeremy broke up with Jill and that is why john is glad that Jill has found another really nice guy to date But I think that makes Jeremy sort of regret breaking up with her because you can tell by watching them how much they still care for each other Its kind of frustrating since I kind of like Jeremy now This sounds like some sort of soap opera I Have never been into watching those although my sister used to watch Days of our Lives religiously I Am wondering if anyone is really going to read this since there is no wrong or right answer The assignment was to write for at least 20 minutes and that is it So is somebody going to read this or are you just going to check off names to see that it was done I think another reason I want to get this job other than making money well I guess it is making money because there are a lot of things I want to buy Every time I go to the book store I see this little disc man that I really want I do not have a CD player here remember  and I could use it in my car this summer I really want a CD player for my car Well if I get hired today I will go out and reward myself by buying that disc man I went to my friend Jeds ranch this weekend I came up with this awesome idea I want to get a climbing harness and rig up some ropes so I can throw the rope over a tree limb hook it back to me and hitch myself up and sit among the tree branches I think this is an awesome idea so it probably already exists in some form or fashion Basically Ill need all the things they use to rappel down cliffs I Am going to go the gym to check out the equipment and how it works to decide what kind of design Ill need My 20 minutes are up I think I went over but I do not know by how much Would Not it suck if I accidentally hit the clear button instead of the submit button I will have to be very careful I just remembered

       "  'So school has been interesting so far I Have come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like and I Have surprised myself to find that it would be completely different At the time I have become increasingly known by a nickname that was not even self imposed I Have created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to People love dat Boi Tony but hey I guess I Am not too mad about it its good in the end in some ways and in some ways not like for example if I want people to know who I am then they really do know who I am and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way but on the other hand since people think they know who I am they will not bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who I am really who am I anyway  can it be defined by a label or name  does it matter if I am Anthony Derrell Williams Tony or Dat Boi Tony because some people can remember my name at all I guess in some facets it really is irrelevant but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant lol its like significance drives us like a since of purpose much like Agent Smith from the Matrix but that movie was flawed in itself It had no purpose It started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end  but that just did not work However Quentin Tarentino did it right when I he made Kill Bill  it was a simple plot with a unique character development and that was the important part many people thought that it was the action but it truly was the characters that made the movie that is why vol 2 is better than vol 1 no matter what the next person tells you sure vol 1 was composed of the best action sequences since the old Bruce Lee days who is still better than Jackie Chan and Jet Li but the story itself is what should draw you on another note a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see and now hes getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care The problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature he cannot take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself the thinks he is fine as who he is Emo SUCKS though I had no formulated opinion about it until I seen what it is doing to him he needs help for real the funniest part about it is that my friend ended his cruel conversation with him by quoting Nietzsche God is Dead   which is a very interesting quote a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason they are a tool if they inject reason and use logic to prove why God is alive then they are less of one the point is that the religious texts such as the Koran the Bible etc were written by man inspired by God which means they are subject to flaws inherently and maybe intentionally   if you could tell the people thus said the lord and you did not want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish then that is what you would tell them after all some people read from texts translated by Shakespeare but I digress I as a Christian would only have this much to say in return if God is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed And if he truly is God and did exist  Death has no binding power defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic What is death what is death to a man what is death to a beast what is death to a god And then I would say yes God in the form of man Jesus did die for you and I there is always a way to explain something in the logical realm however some people are too closed minded to see even that Sometimes philosophy even pomo philosophy can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory that persons faith has become that much stronger Well yester I went to a labor day cookout and there were some fine ladies there You never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you that is the funny part about it all I do not try that hard enough I just wonder what other peoples perception is of me could I have had a chance with any of those girls probably but not likely and this is where my reckoning begins what are these girls looking for attention relationships  or just good sex   I could provide them with all 3 but hey there is only a small amount of me to go around all jokes aside with the truth being told I really think attention is the centric thing that girls want how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story because girls are all so different but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail and I like to look at detail that is why I think I might be staying single for a while even as hard as that is in a place like UT Austin ',\n",

does not matter that is not the point of this excercise i really like psychology its really interesting dumb scientologists told me that it was a overrated science and that more people were killed in the era that psychology was born i wonder if it was because more people were killed that psychology became more important i thought more peeps were killed because technology was greater potential to kill was greater scientologists are creepy they are so cultist i wonder if they are as brainwashed as i feel they are and i am just rambling but i guess that is what were supposed to do my hands are just doing what they normally do when they type i kind of am randomly putting punctuation does stream of conscious require punctuation i hope not this is getting rather tedious but i have to finish it my feel are getting cold and i am getting kind of bored i think i should raise the blinds to let more sunlight in and put on a sweater the ac is really high in my room antartica aruna calls it i love aruna she is such a great sister is this a narrative or a record of my thoughts and feelings i feel like i should be telling about what i am doing but maybe i should just put down what i am thinking what am i thinking ear itches got to scratch it and my hands are like a separate entity they keep on continuously typing and my mind is just running in a completely different direction i guess it is easier to do this sort of thing online and on the computer if I was writing i would hate this it would not flow as much wow so i think i am lining up thoughts in my head to put down on paper is this what i do in essays maybe that is why my essays are not very great i do not really think them out i just blurt them out on to paper like i do in conversation that is a bad trait i type kind of fast how long is this supposed to be i am glad i am getting this down i am curious as to what the results are and i really want to do well in this class its really cool too bad i had to sit in the very back last time i feel sort of like an outcast do i feel like an outcast in other situations i used to wanted to be a psychologists why did i decide against that again and am i getting down the connections of why i am thinking this thought then that thought should i be writing that down that this makes me think of that and that is why i said this i guess thoughts just spontaneously came to my mind and i write them down maybe this makes me more impulsive in my regular life am i weird am i blanked out for a second i keep blocking out the sensation of my body except for the feeling of my elbows continously rubbing against the table the the palms of my hands against the keyboard crick in neck again i wonder if i have trouble studying because i get into uncomfortable positions and that is why i cannot lose myself into the words on the text like i do when reading novels it would be interesting to hear or see other peoples stream of conscious writing if you are writing a novel in the stream of conscious way can you go back and edit it i guess so that is a dumb question its a novel meant to guide you through the stream of conscious not actually a stream of conscious writing that would be messed up if you did a story i do not think i know what i am trying to say next topic 14 minutes wow i did not think time was flying by so fast 1tym with that song is good i wish i could understand korean good songs what does this stream of conscious say about me i keep shifting and my butts going numb and little patches of skin are itchy i have to go at 4 to port aransas i hope its worth it i have a lot of catching up to do i had so much fun yesterday i wish that that could happen more often allen is awesome too bad soap operas and stuff happen too bad  i like both guys is that a problem who wants to hear about this not me its just a bad cycle of thought better think positively scientologists look all blank behind the eyes very creepy as if their cultish mindset has washed all personality way and they are all clones or machines programmed to thinki and persuade in a certain way that is too weird i cannot believe i almost bought into it actually i can i just want to be a better me who does not that   easy   solution they provide is really attractive if it works but look at them they are creepy and give me strange vibes only 4 more minutes yay i am not depressed like they said that is really sad i just like to analyze and see why people do morbid bad things i just like listening and now i am all defensive i should not do that i have nothing to defend against no one is attacking me silly iim just writing down my thoughts i guess that whole experience traumatized me and i have more stress because of it my hair is tickling me its so quiet i heard a door slam i wonder who that is i need to talk to more people on my wing i guess i can do that this weekend but i should really focus more on studying i have such a distracted personality but i guess i have charm so its okay that is what i am told but what do i want  i have to figure that out my legs are crossed its a cool feeling but at the same time i cannot hold that position for long my mind really makes some strange leaps but what about geniuses how do they think do their minds differ all that much I wonder if they really have a different brain wave or patter oon 19 minutes ooh 30 seconds i am almost through i wonder what they have to say this is exciting very cool very very cool i should have solved math equations that would have been cool but that is not the point of this i am such a nerd do i

       "  ' Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing I am kind of stressed out but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved Getting involved however has never been a problem for me I love to be involved in everything Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company I am beginning to get nervous just because I have not really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I Have been away from home I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience I know that I am here to get an education but its obvious to everyone that college does not just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career but its also a learning experience for life lessons I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new huge city but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of yey school is over to wow my life is just beginning along with lots of studying that I do not really want to do   My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I do not belong Yet the funny thing is that I do not really care or maybe its that I do not know how to make the effort to fit in again My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I Have lived in for the past four years even though I lived there when I was younger and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my familys lives have just king of carried on without me I will not really understand my moms relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction '],\n",

      "Truely predicted essay: I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot Alessandra my roommate is here too She Is getting ready to go home for the weekend Shelley and Liz are both going home to They offered me a ride but I Am not going to go because I went home last weekend and I do not want to go home two weekends in a row Although I would really like to see Jordan my boyfriend Hes at work right now and I Am waiting for him to call The sandlot is on the part where Benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard I Have seen this movie a thousand times the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams I always cry in the end where Kevin Costners character plays catch with his dad They did not get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it so I Am glad we are at least trying to work things out He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing But apparently it went alright I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that I forgot to before Actually I just realized now that that is something I need to do Probably should have said it earlier I hope I did not hurt his feelings Oh well like I said I felt awkward about the whole thing in general Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today I was at the Union with Shelley and I went to the bathroom Another girl was going in just as I was and this made my shy bladder act up She went into one stall I went into the other and I just could not go Well she was not going either apparently so we both just sat there for about a minute I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little but then it stopped So the girl pees a little and I pee a little more but I still cannot go all the way I guess she gave up because I heard the toilet flush and she left so I was finally able to go I went back to Shelley and told her the story We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 3rd floor We started talking about Alexs engagement again which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip but its hard to avoid talking about it Before I saw Alexs ring which is her grandmothers Joe did not buy it Shelley told me that it was 1 7 carats which is pretty impressive but then I saw it and looked at it closely and its not that great Its color is not that good and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose Alex either has not seen or is just pretending that she cannot see it Jordan just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes Anyway Alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement wedding thing She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring and she is looking at dresses that are 30000 dollar designer dresses and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding She does not seem to realize that the average middle class family cannot afford something like that But who knows maybe her parents have more money than I think Also I do not know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement She Is only been with Joe for about two months I can hardly think about my future with Jordan now and I definitely could not have thought about it after two months The only thing I can say is that if were still together when I graduate Ill probably marry him But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in New York and if someone is going to hold me back from those things then I have to wonder if that is the person from me I love him so much but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because hes my first love and all that Hes such a great person though I hope no matter what happens that he will always be in my life I just do not want to break his heart or have my heart broken I hope when it stops working it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends Well I have ten seconds left so I think I Am going to call him now   \n",
