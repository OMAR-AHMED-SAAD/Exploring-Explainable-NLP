# Exploring Explainable NLP

This repository contains the code and resources for my Bachelor project, **Exploring Explainable NLP**. The focus of this project is to use explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME, combined with personality traits, to explain model predictions for determining whether someone has entrepreneurial traits.

## Overview

In this project, I explored the use of various explainability techniques to understand the predictions of NLP models in the context of entrepreneurial personality traits. Specifically, I employed SHAP and LIME to interpret model decisions and fine-tuned several transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, Longformer) to infer personality traits that contribute to the prediction of being an entrepreneur or not.

### Key Components:
- **Explanation Methodologies**: SHAP and LIME were used to provide interpretability to model predictions.
- **Personality Trait Inference**: Fine-tuning of BERT, RoBERTa, and Longformer for personality trait analysis.
- **Entrepreneur Detection Demo**: A live demo of the entrepreneur detection model is available [here](https://guchub.me/models/entrepreneur_detection).
- **Thesis**: The full thesis documenting the project findings can be accessed [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.16499.13607).

## Project Structure

- **Models**: This directory contains the fine-tuned versions of BERT, RoBERTa, and Longformer used for personality trait inference.
- **Explanation Methods**: Implementations of SHAP and LIME for explainability.
- **Presentations**: A folder containing presentations showing progress across various stages of the project.
- **Demo**: The entrepreneur detection model available as a demo.
